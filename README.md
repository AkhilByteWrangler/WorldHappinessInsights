## **Dataset**

The dataset contains various metrics that influence happiness across countries, including:
- **Log GDP per capita**: Economic strength.
- **Social support**: Interpersonal relationships.
- **Healthy life expectancy**: Health-related metrics.
- **Freedom to make life choices**: Personal freedoms.
- **Generosity**: Philanthropy levels.
- **Perceptions of corruption**: Institutional trust.
- **Positive/Negative affect**: Emotional balance.

**Target Variable**: `Life Ladder` (Happiness Index).

**Source**: This dataset is derived from the **World Happiness Report** and can be accessed at [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/). The report is an authoritative source on the global state of happiness, providing data-driven insights into what drives well-being across the globe.

## **Data Pipeline**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- **Handling Missing Data**: Missing values are imputed using mean strategy (SimpleImputer).
- **Outlier Management**: Outliers are clipped using the Inter Quartile Range (IQR) method.
- **Scaling**: Numerical features are scaled using `StandardScaler`.

---

### **2. Feature Engineering**
New features are derived to enhance model performance:

| **Feature Name**                | **Formula**                                                                                                                                      | **Hypothesis**                                                                                      |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Economic_Social_Index**        | `Economic_Social_Index = (Log GDP per capita * 0.7) + (Social support * 0.3)`                                                                    | GDP and social support are the strongest drivers of happiness, with GDP having a more direct impact. |
| **Emotional_Stability**          | `Emotional_Stability = Positive affect - Negative affect`                                                                                       | Positive emotions and fewer negative emotions improve happiness.                                   |
| **Freedom_Corruption_Ratio**     | `Freedom_Corruption_Ratio = Freedom to make life choices / (Perceptions of corruption + 1e-6)`                                                   | A balance of freedom and lower corruption correlates with higher happiness.                        |
| **Generosity_Corruption_Adjustment** | `Generosity_Corruption_Adjustment = Generosity - Perceptions of corruption`                                                                     | Generosity‚Äôs impact is stronger when corruption is low, as corruption undermines perceived benefits. |
| **Happiness_Trend**              | `Happiness_Trend = Log GDP per capita (current year) - Log GDP per capita (previous year)`                                                       | Year-over-year GDP growth reflects improving conditions, boosting happiness.                        |
| **Well_Being_Index**             | `Well_Being_Index = (Healthy life expectancy at birth * 0.5) + (Freedom to make life choices * 0.25) + (Social support * 0.25)`                  | Health, freedom, and social support collectively influence perceived well-being, with health as the strongest factor. |
| **Normalized_Generosity**        | `Normalized_Generosity = (Generosity - mean(Generosity)) / std(Generosity)`                                                                      | Standardizing generosity reduces bias from extreme values and enables fairer comparison.            |

### **3. Data Splitting**
Data is split into training and testing datasets (80-20 ratio) to ensure fair evaluation. And also we conducted 3-fold cross validation. 

---

## **Models**

### **1. Random Forest (Non-Deep Learning Model)**
- A robust ensemble-based decision tree model.
- Tuned using RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.
- Handles non-linear relationships and provides feature importance.

### **2. Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)**
- A deep learning architecture specialized for sequential data.
- Captures time-dependent patterns like GDP trends over years.
- Uses causal padding to respect the temporal order of data.

## **Evaluation Metrics & Relevance of Metrics to the Dataset and Task**

| **Metric**            | **Why Relevant to Our Dataset and Task**                                                                                  | **Specific Insights**                                                                                              |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  | Captures large deviations in predictions, penalizing extreme errors (e.g., very high or low happiness scores).                  | Ensures the model doesn‚Äôt make significant errors for countries with unusual happiness trends or scores.          |
| **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** | Provides an intuitive measure of average prediction error in the same unit as the happiness score (`Life Ladder`).            | Helps policymakers understand how far off predictions are, on average, for each country‚Äôs happiness score.        |
| **R¬≤ (Coefficient of Determination)** | Measures how well the model explains variance in happiness scores, highlighting key drivers like GDP or social support.     | Indicates whether the model captures the primary factors influencing happiness across diverse countries.          |
| **Explained Variance** | Validates R¬≤ by ensuring robustness against outliers or skewed happiness scores in the dataset.                                      | Confirms that the model explains happiness variability consistently, even for extreme cases (e.g., war-torn areas). |
| **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** | Shows relative prediction errors, enabling easy comparison of errors across countries with differing happiness scales.         | Highlights model performance across regions with varying happiness levels (e.g., Scandinavian vs. African nations). |
| **Max Error**          | Identifies the worst-case prediction error, which is crucial for ensuring robustness in real-world applications.                     | Ensures that no country receives a highly inaccurate happiness prediction, which could lead to misleading insights. |
